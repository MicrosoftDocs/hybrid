# Hybrid app pattern

Learn how to build a hybrid application that spans both Azure and Azure Stack Hub.

## Context and problem

Many organizations collect and store substantial amounts of customer-sensitive data and are often prevented from storing that data in the public cloud due to corporate regulations or government policy. Those organizations want to take advantage of the scalability of the public cloud to deal with seasonal peaks in traffic and to be able to pay for exactly the hardware they need, when they need it.

## Solution architecture

The solution takes advantage of the compliance benefits of the private cloud, and combines them with the scalability of the public cloud. Using Azure and Azure Stack, a consistent hybrid cloud, developers are able to take advantage of the vast Microsoft developer ecosystem and apply their skills to both public cloud and on-premises environments.

Weâ€™ve created a workflow that allows developers to deploy an identical web application to a public and private cloud and be able access a non-internet routable network hosted on the private cloud. These web applications are monitored and upon a significant increase in traffic, a program can trigger the manipulation of DNS records to redirect traffic to the public cloud, and vice versa when traffic is no longer significant.

## Components

This solution uses the following components:

| Layer | Component | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Azure |  |  |
| | Azure App Services | Build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and serverless compute applications and as well as leveraging RESTful APIs running on any platform with Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings. For more information about Azure App Services see Microsoft Azure App Services Overview. |
| Azure Stack Hub |    |             |
| | Compute, SQL Server VM | Use the same application model, self-service portal, and APIs enabled by Azure. Azure Stack IaaS allows for a broad range of open source technologies for consistent hybrid cloud deployments. |
| Azure DevOps | | |
| | Azure DevOps Account | Quickly set up continuous integration for build, test and deployment. For more information, see [Sign up, sign in to Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates?view=azure-devops). |
