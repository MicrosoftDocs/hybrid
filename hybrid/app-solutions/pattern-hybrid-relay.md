# Hybrid relay pattern

Learn how to connect to resources or devices at the edge, that are protected by firewalls using Azure Service Bus Relays.

## Context and problem

Edge devices are often behind a corporate firewall or NAT device. Although they're secure, they may be unable to communicate with the public cloud, or edge devices on other corporate networks. It may be necessary to expose certain ports and functionality to users in the public cloud in a secure manner. 

## Solution

The hybrid relay pattern uses Azure Service Bus Relays to establish a WebSockets tunnel, between two endpoints that can't directly communicate. Devices that aren't on-premises, but need to connect to an on-premises endpoint,  will connect to an endpoint in the public cloud. This endpoint will redirect the traffic, on predefined routes over a secure channel. An endpoint inside the on-premises environment receives the traffic, and routes it to the correct destination.

Here's how the solution works: 

1. A device connects to the Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure, on a predefined port.
2. Traffic is forwarded to the Service Bus relay in Azure.
3. The VM on Azure Stack Hub, which has already established a long-lived connection to the Service Bus Relay receives the traffic and forwards it on to the destination.
4. The on-premises service or endpoint processes the request. 

## Components

This solution uses the following components:

| Layer | Component | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Azure | Azure VM | An Azure VM provides a publicly accessible endpoint for the on-premises resource. |
| | Azure Service Bus Relay | An [Azure Service Bus Relay](/azure/service-bus-relay/) provides the infrastructure for maintaining the tunnel and connection between the Azure VM and Azure Stack Hub VM.|
| Azure Stack Hub | Compute | An Azure Stack Hub VM provides the server-side of the Hybrid Relay tunnel. |
| | Storage | The AKS engine cluster deployed into Azure Stack Hub provides a scalable, resilient engine to run the Face API container.|

## Issues and considerations

Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this solution:

### Scalability 

This pattern only allows for 1:1 port mappings on the client and server. For example, if port 80 is tunneled for one service on the Azure endpoint, it can't be used for another service. Port mappings should be planned accordingly. The Service Bus relay and VMs should be appropriately scaled to handle traffic.

### Availability

These tunnels and connections aren't redundant. To ensure high-availability, you may want to implement error checking code. Another option is to have a pool of Service Bus relay-connected VMs behind a load balancer.

### Manageability

This solution can span many devices and locations, which could get unwieldy. Azureâ€™s IoT services can automatically bring new locations and devices online and keep them up-to-date.

### Security

This pattern as shown allows for unfettered access to a port on an internal device from the edge. Consider adding an authentication mechanism to the service on the internal device, or in front of the hybrid relay endpoint.
