3. x

## Components

This solution uses the following components:

| Layer | Component | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| a | [b]() | c.<br><br>|
| Azure Stack Hub | [b]() | c. |
| | b | c |
| | b | c |
| | b | c.<br><br>|
| Azure |  |  |
|  | b | c |

## Issues and considerations

Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this solution:

### Scalability 

To enable this solution to scale across multiple cameras and locations, you'll need to make sure that all of the components can handle the increased load. You may need to take actions such as:


### Availability

Since this solution is tiered, it's important to think about how to deal with networking or power failures. Depending on business needs, it might be appropriate to 

### Manageability

### Security
